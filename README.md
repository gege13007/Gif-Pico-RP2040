# Controlling RGB LED display with a PICO Raspberry Pi RP2040

## Overview
This is a simple implementation of an RGB Led panel (matrix.c) with a RP2040 Pico Raspberry (price 6 â‚¬).
This library is designed to control up to 8 32x32 RGB LED panels connected with a single chain to the Raspberry Pico RP2040.

Even overclocked at 200MHz, the PWM colors palette has to be limited to 4 Bits per channel with 8 panels.
It's even possible to improve the number of colors with less panel. So this implementation is cheap but limited to simple pictures.
Don't try to display complex pictures with subtle color !

This library also include a build in GIFAnim decoder (gif.c).

Here's my prototype with 6 x 32x32 leds panels

## Types of display

## Connection
The GPIO mapping and all connections are described in matrix.h. The control of the chained dot-matrix is made by matric.c. This task needs for speed, and is designed to run in the second of the two cores of our RP2040.
