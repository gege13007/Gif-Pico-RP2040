# Controlling RGB LED display with a PICO Raspberry Pi RP2040

## Overview
This is a simple implementation of an RGB Led panel (matrix.c) with a RP2040 Pico Raspberry (price 6 â‚¬).
This library is designed to control up to 8 32x32 RGB LED panels connected with a single chain to the Raspberry Pico RP2040.

Even overclocked at 200MHz, the PWM colors palette has to be limited to 4 Bits per channel with 8 panels.
It's even possible to improve the number of colors with less panel. So this implementation is cheap but limited to simple pictures.
Don't try to display complex pictures with subtle color !

This library also include a build in GIFAnim decoder (gif.c).

## Types of display

## Connection
The GPIO mapping and all connections are described in matrix.h. The control of the chained dot-matrix is made by matric.c. This task needs for speed, and is designed to run in the second of the two cores of our RP2040.

## Limitations
For now, the PICO was tested only with 32x32 leds matrix, and up to 8 matrix (256 x 32 pixels). This 8 matrix can be assembled in 2 lines of 4 matrix (reverse Z-stripe 128x64 pixels) or in a single line (256x32 pixels). In both case I think it's a MAXIMUM for a small Pico (even overclocked at 200MHz). And in this configuration we have only 256/32 = 8 levels only for each colors ( 512 colors max ).
